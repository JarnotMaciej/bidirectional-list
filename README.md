# Bidirectional list

## Short description

This project implements a bidirectional list data structure in C++. A bidirectional list, also known as a doubly linked list, is a data structure that contains a list of elements, where each element has a reference to both the previous and the next elements in the list. This makes it possible to traverse the list in both directions, allowing for more flexible and efficient data manipulation.

## What problem does it solve?

A bidirectional list, or a doubly linked list, solves the problem of efficiently storing and manipulating a collection of elements in a linear sequence.

Some of the problems solved by this program include:
* Dynamic allocation of elements: The bidirectional list allows for the creation of new elements as needed, without having to pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory.
* Flexible data manipulation: The bidirectional list provides the ability to insert and remove elements at any position within the list, making it possible to implement various algorithms and data structures.
* Efficient traversal: The bidirectional list allows for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions, making it possible to implement algorithms that require access to elements at different positions within the list.
* Easy implementation of data structures: The bidirectional list provides a foundation for implementing more complex data structures, such as stacks, queues, and trees, by combining elements in different ways to create new structures.

## How to use it?

The program can be used as a part of the other programs. Menu was implemented to show capabilities of the application. By default, list of people is assigned to the menu function.
